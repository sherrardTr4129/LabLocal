# LabLocal
Project for the CSH project room. This project will identify tools and then point a laser diode to their home position in the project room. This will help facilitate cleaning of the project room for people who are not familiar with where tools go.

##Usage
```shell
python test2.py
```
This will bring up a window that will identify tools that have been trained into a classifier.
